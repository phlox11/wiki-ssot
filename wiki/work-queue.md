# Repository work queue

This is a deterministic view of structured `work_items` on proposal pages. It is not current product authority; open the owning proposal and then the returned current context.

**Recommended next:** none. Do not invent work; inspect blockers and open decisions below.

Outstanding work: 3. Completed work hidden: 17; run `bun run wiki:work -- --all` to inspect it.

| ID | Priority | Owner page | Dependencies | Summary | Context |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PV-13 | low | [proposal/primary-findability-validation](./proposals/primary-findability-validation.md) | — | Define and validate a meaningful followup_ref contract — Deferred: Keep deferred after Primary validation unless a reproduced disposition escape justifies the contract work. | `bun run wiki:context -- --work PV-13` |
| PV-14 | low | [proposal/primary-findability-validation](./proposals/primary-findability-validation.md) | — | Decide whether a reviewer claim-audit artifact is needed — Deferred: Keep deferred after Primary validation unless a reproduced false-claim incident identifies a checkable claim. | `bun run wiki:context -- --work PV-14` |
| PV-15 | low | [proposal/primary-findability-validation](./proposals/primary-findability-validation.md) | PV-05 | Reconsider source-map and bootstrap review breadth — Deferred: Reconsider only when Primary baseline evidence demonstrates harmful over-bundling. | `bun run wiki:context -- --work PV-15` |
